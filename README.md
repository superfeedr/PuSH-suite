# PubSubHubbub 0.4 â€” Compliance test suite

Use this to test a server for compliance with the [PubSubHubbub spec](https://superfeedr-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html) at version 0.4.

## Example usage

Once you've checked out the repo, make sure you install the node modules (you need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed):
  
    $ npm install

    $ export HOSTNAME=50.116.18.249; export HUB_URL=http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com; mocha test.js  --reporter spec

The `hostname` part is important because it is used to build urls for the publisher and subscriber stubs.
The `HUB_URL` is obviously the hub you want to test.

Note that this won't actually work unless the server behind HUB_URL can access this test server. In other words: do not run this on your local machine, unless it's visible from the web. Also, given the very nature of PubSubHubbub's asynchronous property, testing is quite difficult. For example, Superfeedr will ignore pings on very recently added feeds (spam filtering mechanism).

## Todo

One of the key goals of this test suite is to allow people to run it from a web browser with results served directly from the testing server.

Adding test suites for the subscriber and publisher behaviors too.

## SSH Tunneling

To speed up development, I'm actually tunneling traffic from a public server of mine to my local machine.

1\. nginx config (on public server)

Assuming wildcard DNS is already set up for an existing subdomain, add this to an nginx sites-enabled configuration file:

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name testsuite.example.com;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8455;
            proxy_redirect / /;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
    
Then `sudo service nginx reload`.

2\. ssh tunnelling (run from dev machine)

    ssh -R 8455:localhost:8000 user@testsuite.example.com -N        # blocks shell, add `-f` to run in background

3\. There is no step three! Actually there is: run the testsuite
